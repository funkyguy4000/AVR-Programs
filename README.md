AVR-Programs
============

Various programs for the AVR.  ATmega16 specifically

There are a few libraries although many of them are incomplete and are postponed indefinetly for the AVR.  Much of my development has moved to ARM

The programs avaliable are not maintained although all of them worked when they were posted.  If you have any issues with any of them, please contact me!
